# Step-by-step process for a light integration or data sharing
A light integration or data sharing activation completes steps in the following order:

1.  Get in contact with your local point of contact at Voi;
2. Sign an NDA (Voi can provide standard templates) between both parties;
3. Provide information: 
   - Planned go-live date,
   - Zone(s)/citie(s) you wish to have access to,
   - API(s) you wish to have access to (standard GBFS or standard MDS),
   - Points of contact (account manager, technical point of contact).
4. Sign a Light integration agreement or Data Sharing agreement (Voi can provide standard templates) between both parties, specifying the terms of the integration partnership;
5. Voi will grant you access to the given API(s) and zone(s). You will receive an automated email with your access tokens to connect;
6. Launch;
7. Celebrate!

Voiâ€™s team will be always available at any point of the process for a meeting to discuss and provide guidance.
