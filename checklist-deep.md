# Step-by-step process for a deep integration 
A deep integration completes steps in the following order:
1. Get in contact with your local point of contact at Voi;
2. Sign an NDA (Voi can provide standard templates) between both parties;
3. Provide information: 
   - Planned go-live date,
   - Zone(s)/citie(s) you wish to have access to,
   - Points of contact (account manager, technical point of contact, platform provider, PSP, customer points of contact, etc),
   - Method for Voi to request the partner to perform a refund.
4. Get access to our staging environment for your zone/city: 
   - Send an email to partner-technical-support@voiapp.io and provide us with an email address where you will receive the access tokens + specify which virtual zone/city you want to test the API in,
   - You will receive a secret link from us to retrieve your staging environment access token,
   - Implement our MaaS API in our staging environment and test implementation with virtual scooters.
5. After testing, take a meeting with your Voi local and technical points of contact to agree on partnership terms (financials if needed, customer support process, refund process);
6. Sign a Deep integration agreement (Voi can provide standard templates) between both parties, specifying the terms of the integration partnership;
7. Get access to our production environment for your zone/city:
   - Send an email to partner-technical-support@voiapp.io and provide us with an email address where you will receive the access tokens + specify which virtual zone/city you want to test the API in,
   - You will receive a secret link from us to retrieve your production environment access token.
8. Launch;
9. Celebrate! 

Voi’s team will be always available at any point of the process for a meeting to discuss and provide guidance.
